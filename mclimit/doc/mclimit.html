<h3>Release Notes -- May 4, 2008</h3>
<ul>
<li> Added a new type of bin-by-bin independent error -- Gaussian.
The "Poisson flag" for each template now can be one of these three options:
<ul>
<li> 0 = CSM_NOBINERR  --   No bin-by-bin uncorrelated uncertainty
<li> 1 = CSM_POISSON_BINERR --  Assumes histogram is filled with integer-weight
events and uses Poisson statistics in each bin.  Histograms must be scaled so that
sqrt(n) is the error in each bin.  To scale a histogram back to match the data prediction,
use the scale factor argument provided to add_template.  This option ignores the
error bars supplied with the histogram and uses sqrt(contents) to estimate the Poisson error.
<li> 2 = CSM_GAUSSIAN_BINERR -- New option for this release.  Pay attention to
the error bars provided with the histogram.  Pseudoexperiments are generated with
Gaussian fluctuations around the central value (truncated so they do not go negative).
The fits are done with the same Poisson likelihood as before, but the contents for
each template are scaled bin-by-bin so that they have the same fractional error as
specified by the bin errors, and then scaled back.
</ul>
<li>  Updated the interpolation routines to approximate interpolation of the uncertainties
<li>  Removed the older interpolation routines (originally Fortran and f2c'd; they had been
recoded anyhow and the originals were there just for inspection.  The Fortran originals gave
wrong answers when the optimization flag was turned on, and so did the f2c'd versions.  The new
versions work much better.)
<li> November 8, 2007:  Many thanks to Kevin Lannon for spotting a memory leak in the fitter --
deleting the csm instance did not delete the memory allocated for the covariance matrix.
It tends to build up after a lot of pseudoexperiments.  Now it cleans up better after that.  Other small
fixes as suggested by Kevin's valgrind run were made Nov. 8 -- none should change any answers.
<li>  Dec. 9 Update -- speed up histogram interpolation routines by avoiding TH1::Clone
<li>  Dec. 11 Update -- put text tags on the pseudoexperiment results for easy grepping
<li> I now recommend MINOS be called whenever MINUIT is -- problems seen in a small fraction of fits
just failing.  Problem is, MINOS prints out some text to stdout that cannot be switched off.  So
the pseudoexperiment outputs now have some distinctive text to help separate it from the MINOS stuff.
<li>  Bugfix -- undo_nuisance_response has to reset the errors to their standard values too.
<li>  Bugfix December 12, 2007 -- independent errors in each bin in the pseudoexperiments chose the
wrong option -- fixed.
<li> Bugfix December 18, 2007 -- Interpolating contents and errors separately tripped up if the same histogram pointer
was passed in twice -- it swapped contents and errors twice, and now only does it as many times as needed.
<li> Feb. 6, 2008:  make sure MINOS knows about maxcalls.
<li> Feb. 7, 2008 -- split the parameters for the maximum number of function calls for MINIMIZE and MINOS.
Now have setminosmaxcalls() and getminosmaxcalls() methods of csm and mclimit_csm to control MINOS's maxcalls
separately.  Also move the interpolator which omits the error interpolation when not needed (pflag=0 or 1) 
to production.
<li> Feb. 11, 2008 -- call IMPROVE after calling MINIMIZE in TMinuit
<li> Feb. 12, 2008 -- gracefully handle zero scale factors in fits with Poisson bin errors or Gaussian bin errors
<li> May 4, 2008 -- Copy over the development version of mclimit_csm.C and mclimit_csm.h.  Many additions/
improvements.  Bug fixed in the nuisance parameter constraint code.  Bayesian cross-section fitters
added, with pseudoexperiment simulation.  Alternate integration technique (simpler) added to the
Bayesian limit code.
