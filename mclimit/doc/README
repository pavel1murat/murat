mclimit_csm.C package

The code is in mclimit_csm.C and mclimit_csm.h.  The other
code files, preparetchan.h, tchanlc.C, and tchan_cls.C

function fully as they require external root files. 
ptohtml.pl takes the output of csm_model::print() and makes
a web page of template names and systematic sources that apply
to each template.
